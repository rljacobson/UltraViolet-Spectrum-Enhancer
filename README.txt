NEW IN VERSION 2.0
New features:
* Option to have "Add your comment" float on the sidebar.
* "Show Only New Comments" option.
* Option to "shrink" large comments. If a comment is too long, only the first bit is shown, and the rest is revealed with a "read more" button.
* The Greasemonkey script now runs on Chrome or Firefox (unified codebase).

Bug fixes:
* Major code refactoring. No known bugs.

NEW IN VERSION 1.1
Fixed the following bugs:
* "Always jump to new comments" causes the extension to stop working if there are no new comments.
* Some (or all) controls are unresponsive.
* The controls in the settings menu would become unresponsive after a user was added to the hidden list via the "X" menu.
* Adding a username to the Hidden List from the "X" menu does not handle newlines correctly.

New features:
* Added a few lines to the Hidden List box.
* Changed the functionality of the "Hide username" link so that clicking it for a username that is already on the Hidden List still collapses all comments by that username.

ABOUT

UltraViolet Spectrum Enhancer provides a show/hide button on every comment. It also puts a "direct link" by each comment, too. You can make a "Hidden List" of usernames whose comments are always hidden by default. Add a username to the Hidden List by clicking the "X" on the upper right of a comment. To edit the Hidden List and other settings, click the "UV" floating in the upper right corner of the page.
