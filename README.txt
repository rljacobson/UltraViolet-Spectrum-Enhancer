UltraViolet Spectrum Enhancer provides a show/hide button on every comment. It also puts a "direct link" by each comment, too. You can make a "Hidden List" of usernames whose comments are always hidden by default. Add a username to the Hidden List by clicking the "X" on the upper right of a comment. To edit the Hidden List and other settings, click the "UV" floating in the upper right corner of the page.
