NEW IN VERSION 3.0
The new Disqus commenting system required a rewrite of the extension, and many features of the previous version were made obsolete or difficult to implement. In fact, the current version of the extension now targets disqus.com and should work with any website that uses the Disqus commenting system.

The current extension includes the following features:
* Blacklist Disqus users so that their comments are always collapsed by default.
* Collapse/show all comments.
* Collapse/show all comments for users on the hidden list.
* Add a user to the hidden list using the "X" link next to the username on the post.

Known issues:
- Google Chrome support appears to be broken at this time.

NEW IN VERSION 2.0
New features:
* Option to have "Add your comment" float on the sidebar.
* "Show Only New Comments" option.
* Option to "shrink" large comments. If a comment is too long, only the first bit is shown, and the rest is revealed with a "read more" button.
* The Greasemonkey script now runs on Chrome or Firefox (unified codebase).

Bug fixes:
* Major code refactoring. No known bugs.

NEW IN VERSION 1.1
Fixed the following bugs:
* "Always jump to new comments" causes the extension to stop working if there are no new comments.
* Some (or all) controls are unresponsive.
* The controls in the settings menu would become unresponsive after a user was added to the hidden list via the "X" menu.
* Adding a username to the Hidden List from the "X" menu does not handle newlines correctly.

New features:
* Added a few lines to the Hidden List box.
* Changed the functionality of the "Hide username" link so that clicking it for a username that is already on the Hidden List still collapses all comments by that username.

ABOUT

You can make a "Hidden List" of usernames whose comments are always hidden by default. Add a username to the Hidden List by clicking the "X" on the upper left of a comment. To edit the Hidden List and other settings, click the "UV" at the top of the Disqus comments.
