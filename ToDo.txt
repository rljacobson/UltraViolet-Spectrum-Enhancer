* Unify the Firefox and Chrome/Safari codebase.
* Make the width of the comment box the same as the width of the comments.
* Rewrite the event listener code to use this.id instead of UVCommunicate.
* Rewrite the add event listener code to check for DOM attachment via if(document.getElementById(idname)) code. Will fix bug #1 below.

BUGS:

1. addEvent still outpacing DOM creation on FireFox.

2. UVHiddenListMenu122569 showing up in the Hidden List somehow.

I cannot reproduce this. Perhaps rewriting event listener code to use this.id instead of UVCommunicate will fix this.

FEATURES:

* Put "Add your comment" on the sidebar and have it float.
