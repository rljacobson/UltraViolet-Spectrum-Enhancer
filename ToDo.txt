* Unify the Firefox and Chrome/Safari codebase.
* Make the width of the comment box the same as the width of the comments.

I cannot reproduce this. It probably has to do with the calling order of event listeners. Not sure how to fix it. 

FEATURES:

* Put "Add your comment" on the sidebar and have it float.
